## BARBER

### Built for barbers
We've built barberShop putting the needs of barbers first. We've continued to fine tune barberShop with feedback from our growing community of barbers. Today, some of barbers trust barberShop with their business. Let us help you too, so you can focus on providing the best service for your clients.

### Appointments
#### Manually input appointments
You can manually input single and recurring appointments for those clients who have scheduled with you outside of the app. If you provide the client's phone number, we will text them a confirmation of their booking.

### Comments
Conversations with clients are usually regarding an appointment. Communicate with clients by commenting on an appointment keeping conversations organized and relevant.
